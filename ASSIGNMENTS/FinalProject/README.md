# Final Project Proposal

We have introduced and will continue to develop techniques for real time tracking of human activity. At this point we are asking you to propose ideas for applications of these techniques. The project you ultimately commit to, which might be different than your initial proposal, is what you will be focused on for the remaining month of the semester. Each student should individually present proposals (to maximize the diversity of ideas that we consider) but we strongly encourage you to form teams (2 - 3 students per team) to expand the scope of what you can accomplish.

Your application could be:
    
    - Art
    
        - Interactive system
    
        - Performance
    
        - Media product
    
    - Research
    
        - Comparative study of motion capture techniques
    
        - Classification of sensed motion
    
        - Integration with other technologies
    
        - Construction of non-human skeleton models (multi-person?)
    
    - Game/Play  
    
        - Body as controller
    
        - Incorporation of other physical props/rigging/etc.
    
    - Other ( These are just examples of ideas to get you thinking about the possibilities)



## Deliverables

For the proposal we are asking you to deliver a brief slide presentation. You could propose a single idea with greater levels of detail, or present a bunch of ideas as a brainstorming activity. We will plan for 10-15 minutes per person including time for questions and discussion. 


## Schedule

We will begin presentations on Wednesday, Nov. 3rd and continue as needed on Monday, Nov. 8th.
